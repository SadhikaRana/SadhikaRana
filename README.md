# Sadhika Rana

I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW). 
Currently, I am focused on strengthening my fundamentals in programming, backend development, and core computer science concepts.

### Technical background
- Programming languages: Python, C, HTML, CSS  
  (currently learning C++ and JavaScript)
- Backend and databases: Python–MySQL integration, CRUD operations, PHP–MySQL
- Web basics: HTTP methods (GET, POST), AJAX (XMLHttpRequest)
- AI and data: Generative AI and prompt engineering (basics), data handling using Python
- Tools I regularly use: VS Code, PyCharm, MySQL, Git, GitHub, Figma, Canva

### Projects
I have worked on multiple small and medium-scale academic and personal projects, including:

**Python mini projects**
- Built command-line programs such as small games, utilities, and logic-based tools  
- Used concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, file handling, and modular code  
- Tested and executed programs locally using PyCharm and VS Code

### What I am learning right now
- Writing better and more structured Python code
- C++ and JavaScript beyond the basics
- Data structures and algorithms
- Getting started with AI and Machine Learning through hands-on exploration

### Looking ahead
My focus going forward is on:
- Building a strong base in computer science fundamentals  
- Developing backend-focused and data-driven applications  
- Writing clean, readable, and well-documented code  
- Gradually deepening my understanding of AI/ML as I gain more experience
